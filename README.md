# 100daytracker
Tracker Website to track my #100daysofcode.

I made the following habit to track my 100 days of code.
I allows marking number circles green as seen in a habit tracker.
Haven't added the day fail feature as of now.
I used web storage to store the state of the circles so that the site doesn't reset itslef on reload or closing.
This website is basically a site version of the image link below.
